I remember numerous moments in my life when computers, software, or a combination of the two made an impact in my life. I still remember my first computer â€“ a sea-blue Compaq desktop with an Intel Celeron 900mhz processor and a blazing fast 56 kbps dial-up modem. Then when I entered high school, my parents surprised my brother and me with a reasonably faster HP laptop. It's this machine that hosted my first dive into software development. You see, I chose to enroll in computer science electives while in high school. Armed with my laptop, the C language, and a PhD-trained teacher who once worked for Texas Instruments, I swam deep into various projects, mostly just for learning. And I loved it!
 But then the financial crisis of 2007 happened. Thanks, Lehman Brothers! As a trailing millennial about to begin college, these events influenced my life decisions. My future and stability were on the line. It seemed I no longer had the luxury to pursue an exciting yet ultimately uncertain dream, but rather forfeit it for a more stable career. So, I became a registered nurse. Don't get me wrong. I was still excited about my future. And I have enjoyed more than seven years in the nursing field attending to the critically ill. I don't regret that decision.
 But my original dream was computers. Now, at a turning point in my life, I realized that it was now or never (or, at least, very much later). A friend of mine, who works as a web developer, gave me insight into the current field of software development. And again, I was hooked! I spent the following days researching various possible routes to achieve my original dream. I read blogs, articles, review sites. I spoke to alumni. 
Finally, I decided to enroll in Flatiron School's Online Full Stack Development Course. My first week in the program I realized quickly how much I missed computers and software. I love puzzles; I love solving puzzles. And I thoroughly enjoy fixing broken items. And when isn't computer code broken?! 
I haven't looked back. More than a month has passed since then. Learning has become my full-time job. I am passionate about what I am now doing, and I can't wait to share my journey with everyone.
